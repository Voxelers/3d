# Godot as 3D engine

https://godotengine.org/


## Modelling

Blender and Magicavoxels are both tools for creating models to be used in Godot.

The models must be exported to data formats supported by Godot.

## Layout and Animation

The layout can be achived with the Godot 3D editor.

The animation is partially supported by the Physics engine.
